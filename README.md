# MIPS-Bitmap-Connect4-Game
- A simple Connect-4 game I created for my Computer Architecture course.

-	This program simulates the Connect-4 game. Each time 1-7 numbers keys are pressed, 
  a yellow or red token is placed on the column that is selected. Each number press 
  alternates the color token that is going to be placed on the board to simulate turns, 
  so each player gets one turn. The objective of the game is to try to get four of your 
  color tokens in a row. Whoever gets 4 in a row first, wins.
  
 - Some additional notes:
    -	Since you can press ‘w’ at any time to display the “YOU WIN!” screen, the game goes 
      off of an honor system.
    -	If a column is filled with tokens and a player presses that number column, it places 
      a token off the screen for that player, essentially skipping that players turn.
